# CodeAlpha_Tasks_Secure_Coding_Review
This project focuses on conducting a secure coding review of a Python Flask web application to identify and analyze security vulnerabilities. The main objective is to detect risks early in the development stage and improve application security through proactive measures. The review targeted common issues such as SQL injection, insecure session management, hardcoded secrets, and outdated dependencies. Automated tools like Bandit and SonarQube, along with manual code inspection, were used for security analysis. The project demonstrates how improper input handling can lead to serious attacks and data exposure. It also provides recommendations such as input validation, parameterized queries, secure secret storage, and regular updates. Overall, the project promotes secure coding practices and encourages a security-first approach in software development.
